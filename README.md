[Expo router](https://expo.github.io/router/docs) is new file-based router built by expo team.

You can try expo router samples on `stack`, `tabs` `drawer` and `navigation switching` as shown above.

This has similar examples as [React Navigation Sample](https://github.com/hyochan/react-navigation-sample.git) for comparison.
